# mintable-lite

MintableLite is an API service where users can mint, list and sell their NFTs. Every NFT has name, description, image / animation attributes. Users must be authenticated to mint, sell or buy an item. The app should have three endpoints to list all minted items, mint an item and get details of an item.
